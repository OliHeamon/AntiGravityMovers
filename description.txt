Anti-Gravity Movers is a port of a mod from way back in the early days of Terraria modding - tModLoader didn't exist and instead, a primitive platform known as tConfig existed. 
In around 2012, Skiphs made a mod that added anti-gravity movers (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgZiWb5j6uE).
Now, at long last, this mod has been ported to 1.3.5.3 for all the modern Terrarians to enjoy!
Made as a commission for Sir Bumpleton. The GitHub repo for the original tConfig mod's code can be found here: https://github.com/mikepruett3/Terraria-Mods/tree/master/Anti-Grav%20Mover.
